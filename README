And of course for the RetroArch/Libretro team : "http://www.libretro.org/"

It's a quick hack.
At this time , works the basis but buggy on win/linux/android.

Remember ,Everything not working well, It's a debug release , so expect to more bug.

Default Control :

L2  Show/Hide statut
R2  Sound on/off
L   Toggle Num Joy .
R   Change Mouse speed 1 to 6 . (for gui and emu)
SEL Toggle Mouse/Joy mode .
STR Show/Hide vkbd . 
A   Fire/Mouse btn A / Valid key in vkbd
B   Mouse btn B
X    
Y   E-UAE GUI



Usage without configuration file:
	Launch retroarch , select a startup dsk , and e-uae sould boot.
	

Using a configuration file for your games:
  You can pass a uae configuration file as a rom and the core will load the
	settings and start emulation without first showing the gui. Look at the sample
	configuration file "RickDangerous.uae" for help. You can use that sample as a
	starting point for making your own configuration files for each of your games.


Recommended settings and information for Raspberry Pi 2:
  - use CPU type 68000 and kickstart 1.3 for stability
	- set floppy speed to 1x speed to avoid sound stuttering when loading games
	- 640x400 is suitable for widescreen gaming and fits perfectly for most games
	- you can use the config settings gfx_width and gfx_height to specify resolution
	- study the settings in the sample file "RickDangerous.uae"
	- whdload does not work
	- overall the core performs very well with adf files

Knows Bugs:
	- When load savesate , exiting GUI without reset . You have to re-enter GUI and do the reset .
	- Everything not working well, It's a debug release , so expect to more bug.


We plan to use the core of winuae in the future, but no release date for now.
