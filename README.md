### Joyport control

Some games use mouse instead of joystick. D-Pad can be switched between joystick and mouse control in several ways:

- Use the core option: `Quick Menu > Core Options > RetroPad Joystick/Mouse`
- Bring up the virtual keyboard with `Select` button, and press the key labeled `J/M`
- Press the default keyboard shortcut `Right Control`
- Assign `Switch Joystick/Mouse` to any RetroPad button under `Quick Menu > Core Options`

## Configuration

### Kickstart ROMs

The models require matching Kickstart ROMs in RetroArch `system` directory.

Amiga Forever and TOSEC filenames are also accepted.

Encrypted Amiga Forever ROMs require `rom.key` also in `system` directory.

The core has a somewhat compatible built-in AROS Kickstart, which is used as a fallback when the proper Kickstart is not found.

*It is critical to use ROMs with the correct MD5!*

### Resolution and rendering

These parameters control the output resolution of the core (default bolded):

| Name                 | Values                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Video Standard       | **PAL 50Hz**, NTSC 60Hz                 |
| Video Resolution     | **Automatic**, Low, High, Super-High    |
| Video Line Mode      | **Automatic**, Single Line, Double Line |
| Aspect Ratio         | **Automatic**, PAL, NTSC                |

With these settings all the standard resolutions are available:

| PAL 50Hz Resolution  | Description            |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| 360x288              | Lores                  |
| 720x288              | Hires Single Line      |
| 720x576              | Hires Double Line      |
| 1440x288             | SuperHires Single Line |
| 1440x576             | SuperHires Double Line |

| NTSC 60Hz Resolution | Description            |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| 360x240              | Lores                  |
| 720x240              | Hires Single Line      |
| 720x480              | Hires Double Line      |
| 1440x240             | SuperHires Single Line |
| 1440x480             | SuperHires Double Line |

When using low resolution mode, rendering will be halved horizontally and forced into "**Single Line**" mode. 
Scaling shaders looks great, but high resolution games and Workbench are badly rendered.

When using high resolution "**Double Line**" mode, rendering will be doubled vertically. 
It is compatible with high resolution games and Workbench, but scaling shaders will look ugly. 
"**Double Line**" shows interlaced fields separately (weave) and is suited for deinterlacing shaders.

When using high resolution "**Single Line**" mode, rendering is presented as is. 
It delivers the best of both worlds, and looks great with high resolution games, Workbench and shaders. 
"**Single Line**" combines interlaced fields into one field (bob), which will make high resolution images blocky and jittery.

- Automatic "Resolution" defaults to "**Hires**" and selects "**SuperHires**" when needed (practically only in Workbench and Super Skidmarks)
- Automatic "Line Mode" defaults to "**Single Line**" and selects "**Double Line**" on interlaced screens

## Model overriding

You can force a specific model if a game needs one (AGA games for instance) either by the "Model" core option or by file path tags.

The "Model" core option at "**Automatic**" will default to A500 when booting floppy disks, A1200 when booting hard drives, and CD32 when booting compact discs.

The whole path (filename and directory) will be searched for the following tags if the model is "**Automatic**":

| Floppy | HD/LHA | CD    | String                                      | Result                                       |

|        |        | **x** | **(CD32)**, **(CD32NF)**                    | Amiga CD32 (2MB Chip RAM)                    |
|        |        | **x** | **(CD32FR)**, **FastRAM**                   | Amiga CD32 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM)     |

- (!) Additional tags: **(Denmark)**, **(Finland)**, **(France)**, **(Germany)**, **(Italy)**, **(Spain)**, **(Sweden)**
- (!!) **Maximum 4 disks**

Example: When launching "Alien Breed 2 AGA.hdf" or "AGA/Alien Breed 2.hdf" the model will be Amiga 1200.

Note: **CD32** and **AmigaCD** are a bit misleading, since they have nothing to do with actual CDs. 
They are for automatically selecting the appropriate model with certain WHDLoad slaves and AmigaCD-to-HDF conversions.

## Disk images, WHDLoad and M3U support

Supported formats are:

- **ADF**, **ADZ**, **IPF**, **DMS**, **FDI** for floppy disk images
- **ISO**, **CUE**, **CCD**, **NRG**, **MDS**, **CHD** for compact disc images
- **HDF**, **HDZ**, **LHA** for hard drive images
- **M3U** for multiple image playlist
- **ZIP** for various content (FD, HD, CD, WHDLoad)

### Floppy drive sounds

The core has embedded internal floppy drive samples. External sound samples have to be copied from [https://github.com/libretro/libretro-uae/tree/master/sources/uae_data](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-uae/tree/master/sources/uae_data) into a directory named `uae_data` or `uae` in RetroArch `system` directory.

### IPF support

Most full-price commercial Amiga games had some form of custom disk format and/or copy protection. For this reason, most commercial Amiga games cannot be stored in ADF files unaltered, but there is an alternative called Interchangeable Preservation Format (IPF) which was specifically designed for this purpose.

IPF support is done through CAPSIMG library. To enable it you have to put the dynamic library called `capsimg.dll` (Windows) or `capsimg.so` (Linux, macOS) in RetroArch `system` or executable directory.

Compatible CAPSIMG libraries for Windows, macOS and Linux can be found at [http://www.softpres.org/download](http://www.softpres.org/download) and [https://fs-uae.net/download#plugins](https://fs-uae.net/download#plugins)

Compatible CAPSIMG libraries for Android can be found at [https://github.com/rsn8887/capsimg/releases/latest](https://github.com/rsn8887/capsimg/releases/latest)

Please be aware that there are 32-bits and 64-bits versions of the library. Choose the one corresponding to your RetroArch executable.

### ZIP support

ZIPs are extracted to a temporary directory in `saves`, bypassing the default frontend extraction.
The temporary directory is emptied but not removed on exit. ZIP is not repacked, which means saves and highscores are lost.

This allows:

- Automatic M3U playlist generation of all files
- The use of zipped images in M3Us
- If no compatible images are found, the ZIP will be treated as a directory

### M3U support

When you have a multi disk game, you can use a M3U playlist file to be able to change disks via RetroArch Disc Control interface.

A M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U)).

Example:

`Simpsons, The - Bart vs. The Space Mutants.m3u`
```
Simpsons, The - Bart vs. The Space Mutants_Disk1.adf
Simpsons, The - Bart vs. The Space Mutants_Disk2.adf
```

Path can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.

When the game asks for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch "Disc Control" menu:

- Eject the current disk with "Eject Disc"
- Select the right disk index with "Current Disc Index"
- Insert the new disk with "Insert Disc"

By default, RetroArch will display the filename (without extension) of each M3U entry when selecting a disk via the `Current Disc Index` drop-down menu. Custom display labels may be set for each disk using the syntax: `DISK_FILE|DISK_LABEL`. For example, the following M3U file:

`Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve.m3u`
```
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk1.adf|Game Disk
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk2.adf|Data Disk
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk3.adf|Level 1 Disk
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk4.adf|Level 2 Disk
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk5.adf|Level 3 Disk
Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk6.adf|Level 4 Disk
```

...will be shown in RetroArch's disk selection menu as:

```
1: Game Disk
2: Data Disk
3: Level 1 Disk
4: Level 2 Disk
5: Level 3 Disk
6: Level 4 Disk
```

If `DISK_LABEL` is intentionally left blank (i.e. `DISK_FILE|`) then only the disk index will be displayed.

For games that require a dedicated save disk, one may be generated automatically by entering the following line in an M3U file: `#SAVEDISK:VolumeName`. `VolumeName` is optional and may be omitted. For example, this will create a blank, unlabelled disk image at disk index 5:

`Secret of Monkey Island.m3u`
```
Secret of Monkey Island_Disk 1.adf
Secret of Monkey Island_Disk 2.adf
Secret of Monkey Island_Disk 3.adf
Secret of Monkey Island_Disk 4.adf
#SAVEDISK:
```

Some games require save disks to have a specific label - for example, `It Came from the Desert` will only save to a disk named `DSAVE`:

***Virtual keyboard has a key labeled `SVDS` (CapsLock+STBR) which creates and switches to/from the save disk, which makes this step obsolete.***

`It Came from the Desert.m3u`
```
It Came from the Desert_Disk 1.adf
It Came from the Desert_Disk 2.adf
It Came from the Desert_Disk 3.adf
#SAVEDISK:DSAVE
```

Although one save disk is normally sufficient, an arbitrary number of `#SAVEDISK:VolumeName` lines may be included. Save disks are located in the frontend's save directory, with the following name: `[M3U_FILE_NAME].save[DISK_INDEX].adf`.

Save disks generated by the `#SAVEDISK:` keyword are automatically assigned the label: `Save Disk [SAVE_DISK_INDEX]`.

For games that support multiple disk drives, append "**(MD)**" as in "MultiDrive" to the M3U filename to insert each disk in different drives. Only possible with maximum 4 disks!

### Extra features

- `#SAVEDISK:<label>`
    - Create a save disk in `saves`
- `<disk>.adf|<label>`
    - Set a friendly name (shown in "Disc Control")
- `<disks>.zip#<disk>.adf`
    - Specify a disk inside a ZIP with multiple disks (not needed with single file ZIPs)

M3U playlist supports floppy disks, hard drives (all images are mounted at once) and compact discs.

## LED interface

Libretro LED interface is presented in the following order:

1. Power
2. Floppy drives
3. HD/CD/MD (NVRAM)
4. DF0
5. DF1
6. DF2
7. DF3
8. HD
9. CD/MD (NVRAM)

## WHDLoad

Pre-installed WHDLoad LHA archives can be launched directly without any kind of manual preparing and downloading.

- WHDLoad helper files (Directory or HDF) will be generated to `saves`, `WHDLoad.prefs` will be generated to `system`
- `WHDLoad.prefs` & `WHDLoad.key` & `rom.key` will be copied from `system` to the helper image
- Kickstarts will be copied automatically to the helper image
- To update `WHDLoad:` simply delete the directory or the HDF

#### Overrides at startup

- **(Red)** Hold fire button for launch selector
    - For alternate `.info` launching
- **(Red+Blue)** Hold fire + 2nd fire for `ReadMe` + `MkCustom`
    - For creating default `CUSTOM` parameters

#### `WHDLoad Splash Screen` core option overrides

- **(Blue)** Hold 2nd fire for WHDLoad Config
    - Waits for user input if the slave supports splash screen configurations
- **(LMB)** Hold left mouse button for WHDLoad Splash
    - Briefly shows the splash screen while preloading (default WHDLoad behavior)
- **(RMB)** Hold right mouse button for WHDLoad Config+Splash
    - Always waits for user input at the splash screen

### New WHDLoad.hdf features for old users

#### Major changes

- Slave no longer needs to be renamed to game.slave. The first one is selected.
- Kickstarts will be copied automatically from `system` if they do not exist in the helper image.
- `WHDLoad.key` will be copied from `system` if it does not exist in the helper image.
- `WHDLoad.prefs` will be copied from `system` on every run.
- Supports a file named `custom` in the root of the game.hdf for passing specific WHDLoad parameters when the slave does not support the config screen or when it should be the default, for example `Custom1=1`. It always overrides `WHDLoad.prefs`.
    - ~~The easiest way to create `custom` is to quit WHDLoad (default Numpad*), type `echo custom1=1 >custom`, press enter and reboot the Amiga.~~
    - Script called `MkCustom` for simplest `custom` file handling. Launches after quitting WHDLoad.
    - `MkCustom` will create a slave-based `custom_$SLAVE` in `WHDSaves:`. Essential with readonly images.
- Supports a file named `load` in the root of the game.hdf which overrides the whole launch command, aimed at non-WHDLoad installs.
- If `.slave` is not in the root of the HDF, it will also be searched under the first found directory.
- Saves will be redirected to a separate `WHDSaves.hdf`. Repo provides an empty 4MiB HDF.

#### Minor changes

- Both HDF-files (`WHDLoad.hdf` & `WHDSaves.hdf`) can be located in either RA `system` or `saves`.
- "WHDLoad Support" core option does not need to be disabled when launching a non-WHDLoad HDF which has `S/startup-sequence`.
- `NTSC` parameter can be used with WHDLoad.
- Included `ClickNot` for suppressing drive clicking when drive sound emulation is enabled.
- Included `MEmacs` for file editing (`custom` & `load`).
- Included `xpkmaster.library`.
- New WHDLoad defaults:
    - `ButtonWait` (Waits for a button press in certain slaves when loading is so fast that you can't enjoy a picture or a tune).
    - `ReadDelay=0` & `WriteDelay=50` (These speed up OS switching on loadings and savings. Saves tend to corrupt HDFs with WriteDelay below 50).

#### Latest changes

- Updated WHDLoad to 18.9 (2023-05-04).
- Downgraded WHDLoad to 18.6 due to a save related bug in 18.7.
- Updated WHDLoad to the latest one (18.7 2021-10-23).
- Support for Retroplay LHA installs.
- Support for Arcadia installs (requires KS 1.2, `kick33180.A500` will be copied automatically).
- Show `ReadMe` before running `MkCustom` after quitting.
- Changed HDF filesystem from OFS to FFS. Prevents image corruption on unclean shutdowns.
- Default launch method changed to `WBRun`.
- Better support for games with multiple icons.
- Hold down fire button at boot for `.info` selector. Selector will be launched always when there is no exact match for `.slave`.
- `WHDLoad.hdf` + `WHDSaves.hdf` + `WHDLoad.prefs` baked in the core. No more separate downloads!
- `WHDLoad:` and `WHDSaves:` volumes defaulted to directory mode.

### Create a HDF image for a game

#### Not recommended or required anymore, because:

- WHDLoad specific LHA archives will work directly as a read-only hard drive image
- Directories will work as a regular hard drive image
- ZIP files will be extracted to a temporary directory and can contain any type of supported content

#### But if you must:

To do this you can use [ADF Opus](http://adfopus.sourceforge.net) or [amitools](https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools).

Example, to create a HDF file from a zipped WHDLoad game:

- Extract files from the ZIP to a directory
- Pack the directory in a HDF file with:
    - ADFOpus: see [Allan Lindqvist's tutorial](http://lindqvist.synology.me/wordpress/?page_id=182)
    - amitools: `xdftool -f <NAME_OF_HDF> pack <GAME_DIRECTORY> size=<SIZE_OF_HDF>`
	
Note the size of the HDF specified by SIZE_OF_HDF must be greater than size of the directory to store the additional filesystem informations (f.ex a 1.25 ratio).

## Using configuration files

You can pass `.uae` configuration files and they will be appended to the core option configuration.

If `puae_libretro_[model].uae` exists in RetroArch `saves` it will be appended to the model preset section.

If `puae_libretro_global.uae` exists in RetroArch `saves` it will be appended to the configuration.

If `[content].uae` exists in RetroArch `saves` it will be appended to the configuration.

The final generated configuration output is available in debug level log.

***Note that the use of configuration files is no longer encouraged or necessary. The core has been modified to always use the core options as a base, so that all custom configurations will be appended to the created configuration, effectively overriding the core options. The problem with this is that changing any core option while the core is running will reset all duplicate configurations. Therefore only add configurations which will require a restart or do not exist in the core options, if you must use a custom uae. If there is an option missing that is a must have, please make an issue about it.***

Example 1: You want to mount four non-RDB HDF files. You have one bootable 1000 MB file called `System.hdf` created with `surfaces=1`, and three non-bootable 2000 MB files called `WHDGamesA.hdf`, `WHDGamesB.hdf`, `WHDGamesC.hdf` created with `surfaces=2`. Your HDF files are located in the folder with absolute path `/emuroms/amiga/hdf/`. For that scenario, you should create a `.uae` text file with the following content:

```
hardfile=read-write,32,1,2,512,/emuroms/amiga/hdf/System.hdf
hardfile=read-write,32,2,2,512,/emuroms/amiga/hdf/WHDGamesA.hdf
hardfile=read-write,32,2,2,512,/emuroms/amiga/hdf/WHDGamesB.hdf
hardfile=read-write,32,2,2,512,/emuroms/amiga/hdf/WHDGamesC.hdf
```

Example 2: You want to mount a directory full of extracted data as a hard drive:

```
filesystem2=rw,DH0:data:/emuroms/amiga/,0
```

Windows tip:

- If paths are enclosed with quotes, Windows needs double backslashes: `filesystem2=rw,DH0:data:"c:\\emuroms\\amiga",0`.

Linux tip:

- Leave the ending slash to the path to make sure UAE sees it as a directory.

If you are using RDB HDF files, please use `0,0,0,512` instead of geometry numbers like `32,1,2,512`. The geometry will then be read from the file. This only works for RDB HDF files.
